# LogiTrack

LogiTrack is an app developed for Gruber Logistics. The app collects and processes data through a camera to identify freight vehicles using image recognition technologies and machine learning. It aims to gather comprehensive data on all operating companies, their contact information, routes and fleets. Designed as a casual game for long-haul truckers, it includes a range of engaging mechanics such as points, achievements, and collectibles to keep users active over time. Beyond its primary function of gathering advanced insights into logistics, LogiTrack is built for action. We strive for maximum utility, ease of use, and efficiency.
